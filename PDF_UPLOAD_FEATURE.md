# PDF Upload Feature

## Overview

The PDF highlighter now supports uploading and highlighting custom PDF files in addition to the demo PDFs. Users can upload their own PDFs and use all the same highlighting features.

## Features

### üìÅ **PDF Upload**
- Click "üìÅ Upload PDF" button in the sidebar
- Select any PDF file from your device
- Automatically loads and displays the uploaded PDF
- All highlighting features work exactly the same as with demo PDFs

### ‚ú® **Full Highlighting Support**
- **Text Selection**: Click and drag to select text, then add comments
- **Pen Mode**: Toggle pen mode for quick highlighting without comments
- **Area Highlights**: Hold Alt/Option + click and drag to create area highlights
- **Context Menu**: Right-click highlights to edit or delete
- **Comments**: Add, edit, and view comments on highlights

### üîÑ **Easy Management**
- **Clear Upload**: Click "‚úñ Clear" to remove uploaded PDF and return to demo PDFs
- **Status Indicator**: Shows "‚úì Custom PDF loaded" when using uploaded PDF
- **Demo Toggle**: "Toggle PDF document" button is hidden when using uploaded PDF

## How It Works

### Upload Process
```
1. User clicks "üìÅ Upload PDF"
2. File picker opens (accepts only .pdf files)
3. PDF is validated and loaded
4. Previous highlights are cleared
5. User can immediately start highlighting
```

### File Handling
- **Supported formats**: PDF files only
- **File validation**: Automatic validation ensures only PDF files are accepted
- **Local processing**: Files are processed locally in the browser (no server upload)
- **Memory efficient**: Previous PDF is unloaded when new one is uploaded

### State Management
- **Clean state**: Each PDF upload starts with a clean slate (no previous highlights)
- **Independent highlights**: Uploaded PDF highlights are separate from demo PDF highlights
- **Scale reset**: PDF scale is reset to default when switching PDFs

## Usage Examples

### Basic Upload and Highlight
```
1. Click "üìÅ Upload PDF" in sidebar
2. Select your PDF file
3. Wait for loading (progress bar shows loading %)
4. Select text and add highlights normally
5. Use all features: comments, pen mode, area highlights
```

### Switching Between PDFs
```
1. Upload custom PDF and add highlights
2. Click "‚úñ Clear" to return to demo PDFs
3. Original demo highlights are restored
4. Click "üìÅ Upload PDF" again for new custom PDF
```
